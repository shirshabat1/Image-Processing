With the help of the algorithm, it is possible to identify with a particularly high degree of accuracy what is in the image - sun, sky or forest.
You can download the code and try it on images as you wish (sun, sky or forest) except for the database I attached.


The algorithm is implemented through via machine learning and not by a neural network.
